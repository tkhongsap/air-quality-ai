        "       - 'temperature_type': 'Normal', 'High', or 'Low'\n"
        "       - Contextualize temperature extremes (e.g., 'High Temperature: 40°C recorded in affected area').\n"
        "   - Humidity: Provide both the value and category:\n"
        "       - 'humidity_level': The numerical value as a percentage\n"

        "5. Context for Recommendations:\n"
        "   - Issue Public Health Advisory: Recommended for regions with critical PM2.5 or AQI values to inform vulnerable populations (e.g., 'High PM2.5 Level Alert for Central Bangkok: Issue public health advisory to reduce outdoor activities').\n"
        "   - Implement Traffic Control: Advised when rapid AQI increases are detected in urban centers to reduce vehicular emissions (e.g., 'Traffic control measures recommended in Huaykwang after a 40% AQI increase in the last hour').\n"
        "   - School Activity Advisory: Advise suspension of outdoor activities for schools in affected areas (e.g., 'Suspend outdoor activities for schools in regions exceeding AQI of 150').\n\n"
